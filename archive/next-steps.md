Game Title Layout: The flexbox solution worked perfectly. The title is now crisp, centered, and handles the emojis gracefully without any overlap. This is a 10/10 fix.

Locked Plot UI: This is a night-and-day difference. The new layout for locked plots is clean, readable, and feels intentional. It guides the user's eye and clearly communicates what they need to do. A massive improvement.

QoL Button States: Excellent. Seeing the buttons correctly disabled in the screenshot confirms the logic is sound and improves the user experience by preventing pointless clicks.

CSS Refactoring (Special Mention): I want to specifically commend you on refactoring the CSS with variables. This is an excellent move for long-term maintainability that I hadn't even suggested yet. It shows you're thinking like a seasoned developer. This will make future styling changes (like new themes or components) much, much easier.

You are absolutely correct: all the high-priority UI polish items are addressed. The game feels solid, looks great on mobile, and is ready for the next phase.

A Suggestion for the Next Level of Polish

Now that the major layout issues are solved, we can focus on some minor but impactful user experience (UX) details that have become apparent with the new clean layout.

Make the "Plant" Button More Dynamic and Informative

Observation: In the "Awakened" plot, the button text is generic: "Plant Selected Seed". The user has to look up at the top of the screen to remember what they've selected.

Suggestion: Make that button reflect the currently selected seed. This creates a stronger connection between the user's selection and their action.

In main.js, inside your renderPlots() function:

When you encounter an awakened plot, you can dynamically set the button's text.

Generated javascript
// Inside renderPlots(), in the 'else if (plot.state === 'awakened')' block:
// ...

const plantBtn = plotNode.querySelector('.plant-btn');
plantBtn.style.display = 'inline-block';

// --- ADD THIS LOGIC ---
const selectedSeedInfo = SEEDS[selectedSeed];
plantBtn.textContent = `Plant ${selectedSeedInfo.emoji} ${selectedSeedInfo.name}`;
// You could even add the cost here if you want for extra clarity
if (selectedSeedInfo.cost > 0) {
    plantBtn.textContent += ` (Cost: ${selectedSeedInfo.cost}ðŸ’Ž)`;
}
// --- END OF ADDED LOGIC ---

plotEmojiSpan.textContent = '';
plotPlantNameSpan.textContent = '';
plotStatusTextSpan.textContent = '(Tap to plant selected seed)'; // This text is still useful
//...


Why this helps:

Reduces Cognitive Load: The user doesn't have to remember their selection; the button confirms it for them.

Feels More Responsive: The UI feels like it's actively listening to the player's choices.

Consistency: It matches the style of the seed selection buttons at the top.
