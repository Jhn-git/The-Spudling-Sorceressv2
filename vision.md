## Overall Goal:
Create a simple, engaging, and charming idle/active hybrid farming sim for mobile browsers, using only text and emojis for visuals.

## Core Technologies:
*   HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla JS or a micro-library like Kaboom.js if it simplifies emoji/text rendering and input)
*   Local Storage for saving progress.

## Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - The Core Loop

**Objective:** Implement the absolute basic gameplay loop to prove the concept and core fun.

**Features:**

1.  **Basic UI & Display:**
    *   `<h1>` for Game Title: `🥔🧙‍♀️ The Spudling Sorceress`
    *   Display for current currency (`💎`): `<p>💎: <span id="currency">0</span></p>`
    *   Area for plots (e.g., `div` elements).

2.  **Plot System (Single Plot):**
    *   Represent one plot: `Plot 1: [Empty]`
    *   Tapping "Awakens" it: `Plot 1: [Awakened ✨]` (No cost initially).

3.  **Single Seed Type:**
    *   Predefined "Star Spud" `🥔`.
    *   Button: `[Plant 🥔 Star Spud]` (No cost initially).
    *   Planting changes plot: `Plot 1: [🌰 Star Spud - ⏳60s]`

4.  **Basic Growth Timer:**
    *   Timer visibly counts down on the plot display.
    *   Uses `setInterval` or similar.

5.  **Harvesting:**
    *   When timer reaches 0: `Plot 1: [🌟🥔 Star Spud (Ready!)] - Tap to Harvest`
    *   Tapping harvests:
        *   Grants a fixed amount of currency (e.g., `+10💎`).
        *   Resets plot to `[Empty]`.
        *   Simple feedback: `Harvested! +10💎` (alert or temporary message).

6.  **Local Storage:**
    *   Save and load current currency and plot state (seed type, time remaining).
    *   Basic offline progress: If a plant was growing, calculate how much it grew while offline and update its timer.

**Focus for Phase 1:**
*   Making the core "plant > wait > harvest > get currency" loop functional and clear.
*   Ensuring timers and state updates work correctly.
*   Basic persistence of data.

---

## Phase 2: Enhancing Engagement - Active Nurturing & First Upgrades

**Objective:** Introduce the active tapping mechanic and the first layer of player progression.

**Features:**

1.  **Active Nurturing Mechanic:**
    *   While a plant is growing (`⏳XXs`), occasionally display a "Nurture Emoji" next to it: `Plot 1: [🌰 Star Spud - ⏳45s] 💧 Tap!`
    *   Tapping the plot line (or a dedicated button for that plot) while `💧` is visible:
        *   Removes `💧`.
        *   Reduces growth timer by a fixed amount (e.g., `-5s`).
        *   Brief feedback: `Nurtured! ✨`
    *   `💧` disappears after a few seconds if not tapped.

2.  **Multiple Plots:**
    *   Expand to 2-3 plots, each managed independently.

3.  **Basic Upgrade System (UI & Functionality):**
    *   A new section/button `[Upgrades 🪄]`.
    *   **First Upgrade:** "Faster Growth" (Level 1):
        *   Reduces base growth time for all plants by a percentage.
        *   Costs `💎`.
        *   Display: `Faster Growth (Lv 1): -10% Time (Cost: 50💎) [Buy]`
    *   **Second Upgrade:** "Better Nurturing" (Level 1):
        *   Increases time reduction from tapping `💧` (e.g., to `-7s`).
        *   Costs `💎`.
    *   Save upgrade levels in Local Storage.

4.  **Multiple Seed Types (Simple):**
    *   Introduce a second seed type (e.g., `🍓 Giggleberry`).
        *   Different growth time, different `💎` yield, different cost to plant (if implementing planting costs).
    *   Simple seed selection UI (e.g., buttons `[Plant 🥔]`, `[Plant 🍓]`).

5.  **Refined Offline Progress:**
    *   More accurately calculate growth, factoring in base speed and "Faster Growth" upgrade.
    *   Summarize offline gains on return.

**Focus for Phase 2:**
*   Making the "Nurture Tap" satisfying and impactful.
*   Introducing meaningful choices via upgrades.
*   Adding variety with a second seed type.

## Phase 3: Expanding Content & Idle Features

**Objective:** Add more depth, strategic choices, and stronger idle game elements.

**Features:**

1.  **More Seed Types & "Discovery":**
    *   Add 3-5 new seed types (`🍄`, `🥕`, `🌸`) with unique properties (growth time, yield, nurture tap effects?).
    *   Unlock new seeds by reaching currency milestones or purchasing "Seed Pack Discoveries" from the upgrade shop.

2.  **More Upgrade Tiers & Types:**
    *   Multiple levels for existing upgrades.
    *   New Upgrade: "Auto-Nurturer Sprite 🧚":
        *   Passively "taps" a nurture emoji automatically every X seconds.
        *   Upgradeable levels (faster auto-nurturing, more sprites).
    *   New Upgrade: "Unlock Plot": Buy additional farm plots.
    *   New Upgrade: "Mote Chance/Potency": Chance for a more valuable `✨` (Magic Mote) to appear instead of `💧`, yielding more `💎` on harvest if nurtured.

3.  **Basic "Events" (Text-Based):**
    *   Timed events that appear as a banner:
        *   `🎉 HARVEST FRENZY! 🎉 For 60s, all harvests yield +50% 💎!`
        *   `💧💧 SUPER SOAK! 💧💧 For 30s, Nurture Taps are twice as effective!`
    *   Triggered randomly or on a schedule.

4.  **Visual Polish (Emoji/Text Style):**
    *   Better formatting for plot displays (e.g., using progress bars made of text characters: `[🥔 Growing: Progress [▓▓▓░░░░░░░] 30% ]`).
    *   More expressive feedback messages using emojis.
    *   Clearer UI structure for menus (seeds, upgrades).

5.  **Basic "Grimoire" / Collection Log:**
    *   A section showing all discovered plants (`🥔`, `🍓`, etc.) and maybe a fun emoji-laden description for each.
    *   Tracks how many of each you've harvested.

**Focus for Phase 3:**
*   Providing more content to strive for.
*   Strengthening the idle aspect with auto-helpers.
*   Adding excitement with simple events.

## Phase 4: Long-Term Play & Prestige

**Objective:** Introduce a prestige loop for extended replayability and end-game goals.

**Features:**

1.  **Prestige System ("Ascend to Stardom ✨🌟✨"):**
    *   Triggered when a player reaches a significant milestone (e.g., X amount of `💎` earned, all basic seeds unlocked).
    *   Resets:
        *   Current `💎`.
        *   Most upgrade levels (some might have a "keep X% on prestige" star upgrade).
        *   Planted crops.
    *   Grants: "Star Dust" `⭐` (prestige currency) based on progress before reset.

2.  **Star Dust Upgrades:**
    *   A separate upgrade menu for `⭐` currency.
    *   Powerful, permanent global bonuses:
        *   `Permanent +X% 💎 from all sources.`
        *   `Start with +X% Nurture effectiveness.`
        *   `Reduce cost of all 💎 upgrades by X%.`
        *   `Unlock a special "Celestial Plot" that has unique properties.`
        *   `Increase offline progress calculation time/efficiency.`

3.  **More Complex Events or Challenges (Optional):**
    *   "Trader Visit 🦉": Appears for a limited time, wants specific crops in exchange for a large `💎` bonus or even `⭐`.
    *   "Growth Challenges": "Harvest 50 🥔 Star Spuds in 5 minutes for a bonus!"

4.  **Refined Balancing:**
    *   Adjust costs, yields, and growth times based on playtesting through earlier phases.
    *   Ensure the prestige loop feels rewarding and not overly grindy.

5.  **Quality of Life (QoL) Improvements:**
    *   "Harvest All Ready" button.
    *   "Replant Last Used Seed" option.
    *   Settings (e.g., mute simple sounds if added, change text size if feasible).

**Focus for Phase 4:**
*   Creating a satisfying long-term progression loop.
*   Balancing the game for replayability.
*   Polishing the overall user experience.

## Post-Phase 4 (Potential Future Ideas):

*   More intricate "spell-casting" via emoji sequences.
*   Leaderboards (if a simple backend can be managed).
*   Social features (e.g., sharing progress snippets).
*   More complex storytelling elements or character interactions (text-based).

This phased plan allows for iterative development, focusing on getting a playable and fun core loop first, then building upon it. Remember to test frequently on target mobile browsers throughout each phase!
